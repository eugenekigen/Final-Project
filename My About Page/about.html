                <h4 style="text-align: center;">My Life as a Football Player</h4>
                <p>One of the most significant activities in my life would have to be football ever since I got a hold of the ball in 5th grade,
                it sparked my interest and a fire was ignited.</p>
                <p>Ever since I was a child, I've been captivated by the world of football.
                The thrill of the game, the roar of the crowd, and the sheer beauty of a perfectly executed play have always stirred something deep within me. 
                Football is more than just a game to me; it's a passion, a dream, and a path I long to follow.</p>               
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">Why I Choose Football?</h5>
                <p>Soccer has kept me off the streets, it keeps me focused, maintaining agility, stamina and a side of aggression. 
                The feeling I get when playing soccer is indescribable, the wind in my face, the crowd cheering me on..most importantly the goals.</p>
                <p>soccer relates so much to my everyday life, it taught me teamwork and keeping myself healthy and sharp. The one person that i 
                look up to is Mesut Ozil. The way he plays the ball...He make it so simple and exquisite of which his enthusiasm really drove me to 
                play a beautiful game like him.</p>
