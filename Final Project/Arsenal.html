    He is always full of energy and work rate, and come alive on the ball. In his weekly Team of the Week column, Garth Crooks said "this boy is a Rolls Royce of a midfielder. I'm surprised he doesn't work in the fashion industry as this boy can thread the ball through the eye of a needle".[70] Mark Hudson, the former first-team coach at Huddersfield Town, was also impressed by Smith Rowe, "He drifts past people. 
    He does not look quick but he is and it is with the ball which is brilliant. He naturally glides across the ground and he takes the ball in his stride. He has good vision and a good understanding of the game". Gifted playmaker Emile had to be patient once again last season. Having spent much of 2022/23 on the sidelines, he picked up a knee injury on his first Premier League start of the campaign – our 5-0 win over Sheffield United in October 2023 – that sidelined him for six weeks and 
    interrupted the momentum he had been building with a series of promising cameos. He made 19 appearances in all competitions, and particularly shone in the home win over Luton Town in early April.  </p>

He played in five of France's 2022–23 UEFA Nations League games. In November 2022, Saliba was called up to the 26-man France squad that would compete in Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Marauding left back Oleksandr continued to bring authority to the back line and pose a threat going forward during his second season in north London, featuring 35 times despite being ruled out for a month with a calf injury in February 2024. Often inverting into a midfield role from his starting position at the back, he provided two assists in the Premier League. But perhaps more important was his contribution to the best defence in the league, having settled in quickly during his first season in north London. Alex, as he is known around the club, 
  became Ukraine’s youngest goalscorer at the age of 19 and their youngest captain, aged 24, against France in March 2021.</p>

On 15 July 2023, Rice signed for Premier League club Arsenal on a long-term contract.[44] It was reported that the transfer fee was a club-record initial £100million, potentially rising by £5million in add-ons, making him the most expensive English player, equalling the previous record held by Jack Grealish. Rice plays predominantly as a defensive midfielder and is known for his athleticism and tackling ability. 
    In more recent times, he has begun to build a reputation as a more complete midfielder due to his ball carrying skills and ability to score goals from range, which has seen him be deployed in a more offensive role on occasion as a number eight.[85] He has also been praised in the media for his passing ability. He contributed seven goals and eight assists in the Premier League, and some of those goals were crucial – his first strike for the club was the late second goal in the 3-1 home win over Manchester United in September 2023, and he also helped earn a 2-2 draw at Chelsea and netted the 96th minute winner in our 4-3 victory at Luton Town. </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Platypi', sans-serif; font-style: initial; font-size: small; color: blanchedalmond;">Jurriën David Norman Timber (born 17 June 2001) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Arsenal and the Netherlands national team. Mainly a centre-back, he can also play as a full-back. On 14 July 2023, it was announced that Timber had joined Arsenal from Ajax on a long-term contract and would wear the number 12, previously worn by William Saliba. Arsenal paid Ajax an initial transfer fee of £34 million, with the deal containing add-ons that could raise the fee to £38.5 million. 
    The skilful defender joined in the summer of 2023 after establishing himself for both Ajax and the Netherlands national team, and he is famed for his versatility – he can play anywhere in defence and even midfield – and superb passing range. His handful of appearances for us last season came at left back, from where he looked to maraud forward. Having lifted the Community Shield on his debut, the Netherlands international suffered an ACL injury on the opening day of the Premier League season and, having worked tirelessly on his recovery, finally made his third appearance from the bench on the final day. A senior international since June 2021, he featured four times for his country at the 2022 World Cup. </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Platypi', sans-serif; font-style: initial; font-size: small; color: blanchedalmond;">Thomas Teye Partey (born 13 June 1993) is a Ghanaian professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Premier League club Arsenal and the Ghana national team. Powerful midfielder Thomas showed his value to the team once again at the end of last season, playing regularly during the run in and dominating opponents with his tough tackling, authority on the ball and passing range. He began the campaign playing at right back, lifting the Community Shield at Wembley, but was then hampered by injury set-backs, limiting him to 16 appearances.  Upon signing, Partey stated his desire to help Arsenal "back where [they] belong", 
    describing his decision to move being based on "[wanting] to experience new challenges", while also crediting the transfer to manager Mikel Arteta and technical director Edu. Partey won Ghana Player of the Year in 2018 and 2019.[44][45] Ahead of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, as well as for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Partey was named Ghana's vice-captain. In November 2022, Partey was called up to the 26-man Ghana squad that would compete in Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He did not play again until a month later, which he came off the bench in a 0–0 draw against Crystal Palace.</p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Platypi', sans-serif; font-style: initial; font-size: small; color: blanchedalmond;">Jorge Luiz Frello Filho (born 20 December 1991), known as Jorginho, is a professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Premier League club Arsenal and the Italy national team. Jorginho is known for his composure and versatility as a footballer, which allows him to be fielded in any midfield position. Due to his work-rate, technique, football intelligence, ability to break down possession, vision, and passing accuracy, he is usually deployed as central midfielder in a three-man midfield in a 4–3–3 formation. Although he is not imposing physically, due to his slender build and average height, he is also capable of playing both in a box-to-box role or in a defensive midfield role as a ball winner, courtesy of his tactical intelligence,
    positional sense, awareness, and ability to read the game, which enables him to cover ground, press opponents further up the pitch to retrieve the ball, intercept passes, and start attacking plays after winning back the ball.</p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Platypi', sans-serif; font-style: initial; font-size: small; color: blanchedalmond;">Aaron Christopher Ramsdale (born 14 May 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Arsenal and the England national team. Aaron Ramsdale enhanced his reputation as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League with a commanding season between the posts in 2022/23. He was on the pitch for every minute of our league campaign – the first player to do that for us since Wojciech Szczęsny in 2011/12 – and kept 14 clean sheets. Regularly producing some stunning saves when it really mattered, he won the Premier League Save of the Month award in both March (for his stop from Bournemouth’s Dango Ouattara) and April (from Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah). Ramsdale has represented England at all levels from under-18 to the senior team, 
    and won the UEFA European Under-19 Championship in 2017. He was in the squad that finished as runners-up at both UEFA Euro 2020 and 2024.</p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Platypi', sans-serif; font-style: initial; font-size: small; color: blanchedalmond;">David Raya Martín (born 15 September 1995) is a Spanish professional footballer from Catalonia who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Arsenal and the Spain national team. Experienced goalkeeper David strengthened his reputation as one of the best in Europe in 2023/24 after arriving on loan from Brentford last summer, with 16 clean sheets earning him the Premier League Golden Glove award. A sweeper-keeper, Raya "is renowned as a vocal keeper, as well as one who is adept with the ball at his feet". He "can play out from the back and is happy covering the space in behind", which allows a team "to play with a high line". As a result of his and Brentford's style of play during the 2020–21 season, Raya attempted 300 more passes than any other goalkeeper in the Championship. 
    He was part of the Spain squad that won UEFA Euro 2024. He played one match, starting the final group stage match in a 1–0 win over Albania.</p>
